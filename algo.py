# TO DO:
# 1) Change tracking of traversal from own_graph to writing to a text file, so it persists between sessions and we can pass it around to the team
# 2) Add ability to read cooldown from server response, and set a timer for next move based on what's returned
# 3) Add functions from MUD.py to navigate island.  Can change len(roomGraph) to 500, since we know how large the island is
# 4)
